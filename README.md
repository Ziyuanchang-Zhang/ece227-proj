# Influence Maximization on Real-World Networks

This repository contains the full code, data, and experiment results for our influence maximization study across different real-world social networks. Current focus includes the Facebook ego-network dataset and ----.

## üìä Dataset Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Facebook Ego-Network

* The Facebook dataset contains both full network data and detailed ego-centric subgraphs with rich node features.
* Provides a suitable testbed for both **feature-based** and **circle-based** influence maximization algorithms.

#### Dataset files:

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `facebook_combined.txt`    | Full Facebook network (nodes and edges combined).            |
| `facebook/`                | Ego-networks with `.feat`, `.egofeat`, and `.circles` files. |
| `combined_feat.csv`        | Merged node features for global experiments.                 |
| `ego_circles_expanded.csv` | Expanded ego-circle membership table.                        |
| `diverse_circle_seeds.txt` | Circle-diversified candidate seeds.                          |

## üìå Extension Plan

Other networks can be added and tested with minimal code modification, following the same pipeline.
