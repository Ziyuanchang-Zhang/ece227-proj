# Influence Maximization on Real-World Networks

This repository contains the full code, data, and experiment results for our influence maximization study across different real-world social networks. Current focus includes the Facebook ego-network dataset and ----.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

### 1️⃣ Facebook Ego-Network

* The Facebook dataset contains both full network data and detailed ego-centric subgraphs with rich node features.
* Provides a suitable testbed for both **feature-based** and **circle-based** influence maximization algorithms.
